cd torque
docker build -t xenonmiddleware/torque .
```

# Run with

```bash
docker run --detach --name xenon-torque --hostname xenon-torque --publish 10022:22 --cap-add SYS_RESOURCE xenonmiddleware/torque

# use password javagat
ssh -p 10022 xenon@localhost

# submit
echo 'printenv' | qsub
# should write output of `printenv` command to ./STDIN.o0 file

Note: Torque does not like hostname that start with number, so hostname is required

A docker-compose config file called [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/NLeSC/xenon-docker-images/blob/master/xenon-torque/docker-compose.yml) is included in the repository.
